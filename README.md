## Hi there, I'm Nicolas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior developer living in Lille (France) with over 9 years of experience with various technologies such as php, typescript, SQL and Rust.

Iâ€™m interested in software craft, DDD and lately functional programming.

I'm currently looking for a position in either Lille or Paris as backend developer. You can find my CV [here](https://cv.phonographe.xyz)
